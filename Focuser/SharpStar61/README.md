This addon is a motorized focuser for the SharpStar 61EDPHII scope mounted on the OAT. 
It contains a pulley wheel that goes over the fine focusing control (the brass/gold colored knob) and replaces the DEC arm on one side.
It is dimensioned for a 20mm high pancake NEMA14 stepper.
You'll need a GT2 belt (5cm diameter worked for me) and a GT2 pulley.
