Now with a printed thread for focusing and better mounting for the sensor. Print each part exactly once.

Required Hardware:
- IMX290 & USB cable
- 50/183mm lens ([available at shop](https://shop.openastrotech.com/products/openastroguider-hardware-only))
- 10x M3x12mm screws
- 4x M3x8mm screws (optional) 
- 6x M3 Nuts (2x square nut optional) 
- 4x M4x12mm screws
- 4x M4 TNuts
- some general purpose grease (optional) 

If you want to attach the guider to a Vixen clamp rather than the OpenAstroTracker, print the "Vixen_Adapter" part. You will need a 2020x200mm aluminum extrusion.
